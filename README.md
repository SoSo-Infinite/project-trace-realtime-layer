Project TRACE: Distributed Real-Time Synchronization Layer

This prototype demonstrates expertise in building resilient, highly concurrent data systems using a NoSQL persistent layer (Firestore).

Architectural Focus

Tier-1 Data Integrity: Ensures synchronous state updates across multiple client sessions (nodes).

Authentication & Authorization: Implements basic user session ID tracking (userId) for access control, isolating data ownership.

High-Velocity Deployment: Entire system is contained within a single React component, illustrating the capability for rapid, full-stack MVP delivery.
